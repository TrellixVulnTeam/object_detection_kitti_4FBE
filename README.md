***THIS PROJECT IS NO LONGER BEING MANTAINED. The Official Object Detection repo now supports kitti!***
Goal: Glue between tensorflow objection detection models and kitti-2d object detection data
Status: probably won't work out of the box but will save you time vs googling all over

- scripts to fetch convert the kitti 2D objection detection data to TFRecords
- all my code is in the `object_detection/` directory
- more on how stuff works can be found at

### Incomplete List of Dependencies:

    - Download pretrained faster-rcnn https://medium.com/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdownload.tensorflow.org%2Fmodels%2Fobject_detection%2Ffaster_rcnn_inception_resnet_v2_atrous_coco_11_06_2017.tar.gz
    - tensorflow
    - a GPU
    - have not tested on anything besides Ubuntu 16.05


### Instructions after cloning

```
cd object_detection
./fetch_kitti.sh  # uncomment python create_dataset.py, or run separately if you get into trouble
./train_rcnn.sh
# open a separate shell and run
./eval.sh rcnn_logs samples/configs/faster_rcnn_inception_resnet_v2_atrous_kitti.config# open yet a third shell and run
tensorboard --logdir rcnn_logs
# go to sleep...in the morning,
./freeze.sh samples/configs/faster_rcnn_inception_resnet_v2_atrous_kitti.config faster_rcnn_logs/model.ckpt-431399  faster_rcnn_frozen
jupyter notebook
# find kitti_inference.ipynb and try to figure out what is going on
```

2D Object Detection Benchmark Overview (from KITTI)
===================================================

The goal in the 2D object detection task is to train object detectors for the
classes 'Car', 'Pedestrian', and 'Cyclist'. The object detectors must
provide as output the 2D 0-based bounding box in the image using the format
specified above, as well as a detection score, indicating the confidence
in the detection. All other values must be set to their default values
(=invalid), see above. One text file per image must be provided in a zip
archive, where each file can contain many detections, depending on the
number of objects per image. In our evaluation we only evaluate detections/
objects larger than 25 pixel (height) in the image and do not count 'Van' as
false positives for 'Car' or 'Sitting Person' as false positive for 'Pedestrian'
due to their similarity in appearance. As evaluation criterion we follow
PASCAL and require the intersection-over-union of bounding boxes to be
larger than 50% for an object to be detected correctly.

```
